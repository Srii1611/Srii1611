<h3 align="center"> Hello all, my name is Srikar Mannelli, a passionate and dedicated Business Analyst with a robust background in consulting and analytics. With over two years of experience as an Operations Manager at ICICI Lombard, I've honed my skills in driving data-driven insights, optimizing business processes, and implementing CRM solutions across various dealerships.

My technical toolkit includes: - Databases: MySQL, SQL Server 
                               - Business Intelligence: Power BI 
                               - Data Analytics: Python 
                                - Reporting: Advanced Excel, SQL ðŸ“Š 
I specialize in creating dashboards, interpreting complex data sets, and developing data collection systems that provide actionable insights for business growth. As I near the completion of my degree, I'm excited to explore new opportunities in the Business Intelligence Analyst or any data-driven roles, leveraging my analytical skills to drive impactful results.</h3>
